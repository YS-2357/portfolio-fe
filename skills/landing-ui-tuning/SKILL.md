# Landing UI Tuning

## Overview
Keep the landing page aligned with the portfolio narrative and design rules.

## Workflow
1. Confirm which section is being adjusted (hero, projects, experience, education, awards, contact).
2. Apply layout and styling rules from `references/landing-ui-guide.md`.
3. Reuse existing class names and avoid layout rewrites.
4. Validate links against canonical routes.
