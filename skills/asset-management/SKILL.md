# Asset Management

## Overview
Keep portfolio visuals consistent and prevent broken paths or mismatched styling.

## Workflow
1. Confirm asset type (profile, skill logo, project image, badge).
2. Place files in the standard path from `references/asset-conventions.md`.
3. Use `/asset/...` URLs for anything under `app/public`.
4. Update the React/Markdown reference and verify rendering.
